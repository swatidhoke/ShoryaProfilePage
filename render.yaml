# Notes:
# - Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username or the correct repo URL.
# - The `web` service points to the `backend` folder and runs `npm start` there.
# - The `staticSites` entry serves the `frontend` folder directly as a static site; if you add a build step,
#   set `buildCommand` and `publishPath` accordingly (e.g., when using a bundler/build output).
